# Situation

We found a field name, that is commonly used in our business domain, but sadly
it is used in a wrong way.

We do not want to do this manually across all our projects and also make sure this never happens again.

This is why we decided to create an openrewrite recipe for renaming this field. 

# Task

There are already two tests. 
Please implement the class RenameClassFieldRecipe properly, to make these tests pass.

# Try this at home

Think of more testcases. Extend recipe accordingly.
